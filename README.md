# Hospital Readmission Prediction
### Business Analysis Case Study

## Project Overview
This project explores how hospitals can identify high-risk diabetic patients who are likely to be readmitted within 30 days. The goal is to support better patient care, reduce operational burden, and lower healthcare costs.

## Business Problem
Unplanned readmissions lead to:
- Higher treatment costs
- Bed and staff shortages
- Lower patient satisfaction
- Performance penalties

## Objectives
- Identify early risk indicators
- Support proactive intervention planning
- Improve discharge workflows
- Enable data-driven decision making

## Data Considered
- Patient demographics
- Length of stay
- Previous admissions
- Medication changes

*Note: Publicly available sample datasets were used. No personal or confidential data.*

## Analysis Approach (Non-Technical)
1. Defined business goals and success metrics
2. Reviewed patient patterns and trends
3. Categorized risk groups
4. Interpreted findings for decision-making

## Key Insights
- Longer hospital stays increase readmission likelihood
- Multiple past admissions are a strong risk indicator
- Medication adjustments influence outcomes

## Business Recommendations
- Follow-up programs for high-risk patients
- Post-discharge monitoring workflows
- Patient education and support
- Strengthened outpatient care

## Outcome
This analysis can help hospitals:
- Reduce avoidable readmissions
- Improve resource utilization
- Enhance patient outcomes
- Lower financial burden

## My Role as a Business Analyst
- Problem definition
- Requirement understanding
- Insight interpretation
- Stakeholder-focused recommendations

## Tools Used
